# Automatic Unit Converter
WebExtension (originally created for Mozilla Firefox, not tested on other browsers) that replaces (American) units to their SI/Europian counterparts.

Currently only the english convention is converted (comma as separator between thousands and points to represent floating point numbers). 


Thus far implemented: 	
		lbs/pounds to kg
		fahrenheit to celsius
		
		
Based on example that can be found here: https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/emoji-substitution
